Superhero Class with Inheritance and Polymorphism Challenge
Overview
This project involves creating Python classes with inheritance and polymorphism. Weâ€™ll define a Superhero class and use inheritance to create a Speedster subclass. Then, we explore polymorphism with animals that implement the same action (like move()), but in their unique ways.

Superhero Class with Inheritance
The Superhero class represents a superhero with attributes like name, power, and city.

The Speedster subclass inherits from Superhero and adds special speed features.

Inheritance lets us extend the Superhero class to create more specialized heroes.

Polymorphism with Animals
We define animals like Dog, Bird, and Fish, each implementing their own move() method.

Polymorphism allows each animal to define move() differently, while the method is called the same for all animals.

How to Use
Clone or copy the code.

Run the Superhero Class file to see a superhero and Speedster.

Run the Polymorphism with Animals file to watch animals move in their unique ways.

Requirements
Python 3.x (No additional dependencies).
